# PrincipalComponentAnalysis
## This has PCA model
 #### I have approached this data-set with Standardization of Data-Frame.
 #### Post Transformation, i have applied  PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimension to get better analysis.
 #### After PCA on Standardized Data, then applied different clustering method as mentioned in Problem Statement:
         -- H-Cluster
         -- K-Means 
 #### For every clustering method Silhouette Score was a metric to verify Cluster Number.
 #### I have used Yellow-brick Library which i explored on previous assignment.
 #### Furthermore i have used 3-D plot for 3 PCA components.
 #### Additionally applied tSNE on dataset to check ouput, plotted tSNE output.
